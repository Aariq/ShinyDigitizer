# ShinyDigitizer

An *abandoned* shiny app for manually digitizing scanned scatterplots (and other types of plots and graphics, possibly).  The idea is you'd upload an image of a plot (e.g. from a publication where the original data isn't accessible) and you could click on the axes and points and get a .csv file of the data to download.
